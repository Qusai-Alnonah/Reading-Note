 and we have tradtional dom event handlers it is creating an event hadler but you can only attach one function to each event handler
 <li>Events are the browser's way of indicating when
something has happened (such as when a page has
finished loading or a button has been clicked).
Binding is the process of stating which event you are
waiting to happen, and which element you are waiting
for that event to happen upon.
When an event occurs on an element, it can trigger a
JavaScript function. When this function then changes
the web page in some way, it feels interactive because
it has responded to the user.
You can use event delegation to monitor for events
that happen on all of the children of an element.
The most commonly used events are W3C DOM
events, although there are others in the HTMLS
specification as well as browser-specific events.

* at the html we read aboout form There are several types of form controls that
you can use to collect information from visitors

<ls>  Each form control is given a name, and the text the
user types in or the values of the options they select
are sent to the server.
 HTML5 introduces new form elements which make it
easier for visitors to fill in forms.
also we read about lists table 

* In addition to the CSS p XX roperties covered in other
chapters which work with the contents of all elements,
there are several others that are specifically used to
control the appearance of lists, tables, and forms.
X List markers can be given different appearances
using the list-style-type and list-style image
properties.
X Table cells can have different borders and spacing in
different browsers, but there are properties you can
use to control them and make them more consistent.
X Forms are easier to use if the form controls are
vertically aligned using CSS.
XForms benefit from styles that make them feel more
interactive.
