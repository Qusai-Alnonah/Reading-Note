The story is very touching, and I think it is realistic. I believe that health and psychological well-being are the basis for a successful work, and in order to love your work, you must be comfortable in it in order to accomplish and excel.
And the relationship of the person is very important in those around him, he must be able to communicate with them, dialogue and discuss, but in an effective way, and an answer to reach a solution to all the problems and obstacles that will be encountered in this life.
And the most important also is that his relationship with his Creator is the basis, because your relationship with your Creator is more important than any other relationship, whether at home or at work, for he is the one who created you and he who knows what is most suitable for you and will not carry you what you cannot bear. I have mercy on you from yourself and from your mother who gave birth to you and your labor in carrying you until You became what you are now, so it is thanks to God and then to her
When your relationship with your Creator becomes the best, you realize that you do not need anyone but him because he is in control of you, your life and what it will be, and you will surrender your command to him with your work, grandfather and diligence without laziness or dependency
In the end, I know that what happened to you would not have made you wrong, and what was wrong with you, it would not have befallen you. I lifted the pens and dried the newspapers.
