 <h1> Loops  <h1>
 we use the loops for check a condition run and checked again and again it still returns until the codition is true 

  * For statmant 
  if you need to run code  specific number of times we use for loop 

  * While statmant
  we use while if we do not know how many time the code should run ; the code will continue to loop until the condition is true.
