* HTML pages are text documents
* HTML uses tage to give the information they surround special meaning
* Tags are often referred to as elements
* Tags usually come in pairs. The opening tag denotes
the start of a piece of content; the closing tag denotes
the end.
* Opening tags can carry attributes, which tell us more
about the content of that element.
* Attributes require a name and a value.
* To learn HTML you need to know what tags are
available for you to use, what they do, and where they
can go.
* HTML elements are used t XX o describe the structure of
the page (e.g. headings, subheadings, paragraphs).
* They also provide semantic information (e.g. where
emphasis should be placed, the definition of any
acronyms used, when given text is a quotation).
* some code:

HTML5 LAYOUT<h5>

* The new HTML5 elements i XX ndicate the purpose of
different parts of a web page and help to describe
its structure.
* XX The new elements provide clearer code (compared
with using multiple <div> elements).
* XX Older browsers that do not understand HTML5
elements need to be told which elements are
block-level elements.
* XX To make HTML5 elements work in Internet Explorer 8
(and older versions of IE), extra JavaScript is needed,
which is available free from Google.
